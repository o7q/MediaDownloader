MediaDownloader by o7q
A GUI tool that uses yt-dlp and ffmpeg to quickly download video and audio from virtually any website.

To update yt-dlp:
1. Click on the "yt-dlp GitHub" button within MediaDownloader
2. Click on the releases tab and download "yt-dlp.exe"
3. Replace "yt-dlp.exe" that is inside the "mediadownloader" folder with the new "yt-dlp.exe"
